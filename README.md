# SQL Pewlett Hackard Challenge

I was tasked with completing a research project about people whom a fictional company employed during the 1980s and 1990s.
All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, I will design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, I will perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

## Data Modeling

I created the following ERD

## Data Engineering
I then used  the information given to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

Imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

## Data Analysis
After completing the database, I do the following:

List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).



For this project I used a tutoring session, BCS learning assistant and Stack Overflow.
